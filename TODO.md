### Important
1. Add an improved conveyor belt drawing (creation/design) system
2. Add localization support, storing game text in JSON files instead of within code. This is in response to a couple of translation requests from Omicron Translation Group on the Itch.io page. I [l5474] *might* be able to do it... eventually.
3. Fix some AI going to the wall, as mentioned in #5

### Optional/Low Priority
1. Make minimap ~~or aux. tile loader for whole-map view~~
2. Add in more teleporter colors maybe, and make a new teleporter color picker ui/tooltip. Very low priority
3. Maybe make enemies manually spawnable in Sandbox Mode
4. Maybe assign a key to make Mecha move faster
