- Texture packs
- Online player profiles
- Player mech on Android
- Modding support
- Game speed increase (fast forward)
- Liquid teleporter
- More teleporter colors/any system that gives it more frequencies (numbers)
- More ore generation (if you're playing on maze, *play any different map, maze has the least resources, and for good reason!*)
- Power wires or conduits

### Already Suggested
_(not necessarily planned!)_
- "more blocks" "more turrets" "more content" "more X/Y/Z"
- Building of units (tanks, drones, _soldiers_, doesn't matter)
- Enemy bases, fighting against AI, capture points
- Co-op of any sort
- Campaign, challenge mode
- PvP mode
- Multiple cores, movable cores
- Movable turrets
- Batteries or storage for anything
- Destroy map indestructible blocks
- Customizable world ore generation + seed
- Steam release
- Research system, tech tree, persistent upgrades, upgrades at all
- Missile enemies/turrets/weapons (both homing and non-homing)
- 'Better graphics'
- Enemies dropping resources
- Final objectives/non-endless mode
- Fusion reactor
- Dams, flowing water
- Flying enemies
- Day/night cycle
